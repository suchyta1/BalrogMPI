Scripts for running Balrog in a massively parallel environment. 
Developed on the astro cluster at BNL, but it's intended to be
portable elsewhere, particularly supercomputing environments (NERSC).
It requires some stuff on top of Balrog:
* mpi4py
* desdb
* sqlldr

Right now this works for DES coadd files. It assumes the files
live on disk, organized the way they are at BNL, which
mimics the DESDM file structure.

If you're in DES and looking to do big Balrog runs this is a good
place to start. It's unlikely you'll want to use this as is,
but it a helpful framework to start from, which I (Eric Suchyta)
have successfully running at BNL.
